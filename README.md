## Description
A Python based program of three sequential programming challenges demonstrating the use of while loops, for loops, and nested loops learned in Chapter 5. 

## Challenge 1
The Problem: Implement the Collatz Conjecture sequence.
Input: A positive integer
Output: Display sequence with spaces and step count
Solution: Determines if a number is even or odd and then either divdes by two or mulitples by three and adds one before adding to the sequence of numbers with the amount of steps.
- Uses a while loop instead of a for loop due to unknown amount of iterations

## Challenge 2
The Problem: Determine if a number is prime by testing all possible divisors.
Input: A positive integer greater than 1
Output: Show if prime or not with explanation
Solution: Checks if number is prime or not with a range of 2 thorugh the number minus 1 by % then stating if it is, and if it isn't, what it's divisble by. 
- Uses a for loop due to known range 

## Challenge 3 
The Problem: Generate a formatted multiplication table showing all products.
Input: None (always generates 1-10 table)
Output: Formatted grid of the multiplication table  
Solution: Columns and headers are printed and then multipled with spaces betwem
- Uses nested loops for 2D data
